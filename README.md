# GPL
[GPL] - Get Primary Location. Script, which helps to locate VK user using his friends.

#### Token's rights:
    offline, friends
  
Get [token](https://oauth.vk.com/authorize?client_id=6949573&scope=offline,friends&redirect_uri=https://oauth.vk.com/blank.html&display=page&response_type=token&revoke=1 "Get user's access token VK")

Token is string which length is 85 symbols.  
It begins from `"access_token="` ***(without '=')*** to `&`     

***From version 1.4 You can use this script in yours by importing GPL.py.
Don't forget set module_mod = True in Config.py
***

That's all what I have to say.
